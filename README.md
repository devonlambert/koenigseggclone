# Koenigsegg Site Clone

My goal with this project is to build a Clone of the Koenigsegg website. See my other clone projects to track progress of this whole exercise.

* [Youtube Clone](https://github.com/devonlambert/youtubeclone) - A clone of the Video Sharing site.
* [Rotten Tomatoes Clone](https://github.com/devonlambert/rottentomatoclone) - A clone of the Rotten Tomatoes reviews website.
* [Dupont Registry Clone](https://github.com/devonlambert/dupontregistryclone) - A clone of the Exotic car website, Dupont Registry.

## Why did you do build this?

I needed a quick and dirty way to get back to the basics of Front End Web Development. What I've come to realize is that nothing beats the fundamentals and I wanted to get a solid hold on them again. What better way to do that than to build a clone of something?
